Feel free to submit any fixes and new features as long as the code is nice, simple and well documented by itself (using comments in the code).

You can also look for `TODO:` and `FIXME:` in the code, these are tasks that need to be done.


### No JS frameworks please!

We do not want to use React or any other JS framework for this, please do not waste your precious time rewriting the whole thing. 

Vanilla JS is more than enough for Thermostat and it works great, keeps the code nice, simple and small. And it will last for many many years without the need to do a massive change-breaking upgrade to the newest shinny thing.
