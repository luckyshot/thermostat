## Features

- Control your home thermostat with your phone, laptop or tablet
- Clean web interface with Temperature and Humidity charts
- Weather data from external API (wind speed, pressure, etc.)
- Unlimited sensors for indoors and outdoors
- Access your thermostat from anywhere in the world
- Privacy-respectful presence detection that turns thermostat off automatically if nobody is home
- Compatible with extremely old devices (iPad 1, etc.) so you can give them another life
- Extremely easy to set up, no compiling, frameworks or libraries needed, just vanilla JS and PHP
- Extremely easy to hack and customize to your liking


**Disclaimer**: _Please do your own research, you will be dealing with hardware components, I am not an expert and may have made mistakes or your particular setup may differ._


## What you need (minimum-ideal)

- 1-2 Raspberry Pi (non-exclusive, you can use them for other things simultaneously such as for Kodi, Syncthing or PiHole)
- 1-2 temperature sensors (the second one is optional if you want outdoors measuring, although the weather API works too)
- 1 relay switch to turn ON-OFF the thermostat
- Cable (Dupont wires, although any old/broken USB or phone cable works too)

### Setup overview

- Run one Python script on each Raspberry Pi (set a 5 min cronjob)
- A simple PHP web server with a few files (no MySQL database needed)
- A free API key from openweathermap to get your location's weather


### Shopping list

These are the things I bought and have worked for me, your setup may vary.

- Raspberry Pi (any works, I've got a 3 and a 4)
- [Temperature sensors](https://amzn.to/3tbv3LE) (7â‚¬)
- [Relay](https://amzn.to/3teyIbK) (5â‚¬)
- [Cables](https://amzn.to/3wSyWra) (7â‚¬)
- (optional) [Multimeter](https://amzn.to/2Q3ownQ) (15â‚¬)
- (optional) [Digital Ocean web server](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=b64e38702701) (4â‚¬/month, use the link for 2 months free)

TOTAL: 34â‚¬ (for a 300-500â‚¬ thermostat! ðŸ¥³)


### Compatibility

Compatible with very old devices (including iPad 1 and probably old Internet Explorers) so you can use retired devices as controllers/displays, they just need a somewhat decent web browser. The Web interface has been coded in a way that doesn't require too modern web technologies.


## My setup

I've got two Raspberry Pi: one I use it for watching TV (using LibreElec+Kodi) so it sits besides my TV and the other one is a file backup generator (using Syncthing) that can be placed anywhere.

Raspberry 1 will detect indoor temperature and presence, and Raspberry 2 will detect outdoors temperature and activate the Thermostat On/Off through the relay.

My Thermostat activates through a cable running at 26.7VAC 8.68mA (measured thanks to the Multimeter I bought for 15â‚¬). When this cable is bridged it turns ON, and when you unbridge it it turns Off. I got a relay which can handle up to 250V and 10A, it's inexpensive and you'd better get something decent for safety reasons and so you can reuse for other projects.


### Overview

- Raspberry 1 (indoors, living room)
    - Hardware:
        - Temperature sensor
    - Software:
        - Send temperature and humidity
        - Detect presence
- Raspberry 2 (outdoors, next to the thermostat)
    - Hardware:
        - Relay (on/off switch) connected to the Thermostat cable
        - Temperature sensor (placed outdoors with a long cable so we get accurate exterior temperature)
    - Software:
        - Send temperature
        - GET /status to see if 1 or 0 and turn on or off the rele (HARD)
- Web Server (PHP, SQLite, Apache):
    `sudo apt-get install php7.4-sqlite3`
    - PHP script
        - Web portal
            - User Interface
            - Manual on/off buttons and timers ("set it on for 30 minutes")
            - Chart: temperature, humidity, status, event logs (manual on/off, manual_off_interval...)
        - API
            - Receive data from all devices
            - Return thermostat status


## SETUP

### Generate a security token

You can use this tool https://xaviesteve.com/pro/tools.php (Password generator) to create a 128-256 string and save it in a file called `.httoken`. Place this file in the same folder as your `thermo.py` and `index.php` scripts.

### Customize parameters

(optional) You can edit `index.php` (or `params.php` once it has been generated on first run) to customize a few extra settings such as the weekly schedule, your coordinates, Weather API key and so on.

### Thermostat Raspberry

For the Raspberry with the Thermostat ON/OFF Relay:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wiringpi

# You probably don't need this: `sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio python-pip`
# This shows info on all pins `gpio readall`
```

### Presence Raspberry

For the Raspberry that will do the presence detector

```bash
pip install pythonping
```

Now give your smartphones' fixed IPs and add them to the `thermo.py` file.


### Temperature Raspberry

For the Raspberry with the temperature sensor:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-core
git clone https://github.com/szazo/DHT11_Python.git
cd DHT11_Python
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install -U setuptools
python3 -m pip install .
```

The GPIO pins for temperature sensor (Raspberry 3B and 4B) that I have used looks like this:

                Â¡
Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·3Â·Â·Â· Â¡
Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·2Â·1 Â¡
----------------/

1. (+) Red
2. (-) Black
3. (out) Brown


### All Raspberries

Set a static IP on all your Raspberry Pi

```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Scroll to the bottom and add this:

```bash
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.0.201/24
static routers=192.168.0.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
```

Now put the token on all your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
cd ~
nano .httoken
# Paste the generated token and save the file
```

Install the script on all your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
nano thermo.py
# Paste the thermo.py code
# Customize the tasks you want this Raspberry to do
# Save the file and exit nano
chmod u+x thermo.py
./thermo.py
```

Install the cron on all your Raspberry Pi

```bash
sudo apt-get install cron
sudo crontab -e
```

Cronjob (every 5 minutes)

```bash
@reboot ~/thermo.py
*/5 * * * * ~/thermo.py
```



### Other useful commands

#### To run the script manually do

- `~/thermo.py`

#### To set pin 24 to High

`gpio -g mode 24 out`
`gpio -g write 24 1`


## How does presence detection work?

I hated the idea of having cameras or microphones listening all the time so I came with the idea of simply tracking specific devices connected to the home's Wi-Fi. For example, my mobile phone. If I'm home, my phone will be with me and auto-connect to the Wi-Fi, and disconnect when I leave home.

It doesn't track individually, it just tracks if there's any of the devices connected. You could even set your TV to be the device, or a smart bulb. If you set your phone you can always disable Wi-Fi and use cellular data to remain undetected.
